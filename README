##Problem##
>you can access a webspace only via ftp. and you can not unpack the archive with your ftp client :(


##Three (3) quick steps to solve your problem##



1. pack your files from the root directory of your page.
   e.g. /var/www/localhost/<your_page_files>
   -> you pack your files from /var/www/localhost: tar -czf unpack.tgz <your_folder_1>/ <your_folder_2>/ <your_file.php>

2. upload this file (e.g. unpack.php) plus your archive (e.g. unpack.tgz) to your webspace root folder (e.g. htdocs or wtf) with your â™¥ ftp tool 

3. switch to your browser and hit http://example/unpack.php and wait... your done!
   [optional] archive | e.g. http://example/unpack.php?archive=<your_archive.tgz>
